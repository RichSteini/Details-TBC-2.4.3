# Details-TBC-2.4.3
Details! backported for TBC 2.4.3

Raider or PVP player doesn’t matter, we are always searching for more Intel, ways to make deep analyses, and methods to know everything that’s going on around us. From casual to theory crafter, knowledge is essential for growing as a player. If you fit in this profile, if you want to know from a simple “how much damage I’m doing” to more complex “how many times a healer casted that cooldown on the main tank”, Details! is an addon for you!
